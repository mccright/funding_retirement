# Understanding Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)  

"**You can't keep funds in a traditional IRA (including SEP and SIMPLE IRAs) indefinitely.  Eventually, they must be distributed. If there are no distributions, or if the distributions aren't large enough, you may have to pay an excise tax on the amount not distributed as required.**" [[IRS Pub. 590-B (2024)](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100090420)]  

Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) are the minimum amounts you must withdraw from your traditional IRA, SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA, and certain other retirement plans once you reach age 73.  

### When to Start Taking RMDs  

As of Summer 2025...  
* You must begin taking RMDs by April 1 of the year following the year you turn 73.  
* If you delay your first RMD until April 1, you will need to take a second RMD by December 31 of the same year.  

### How to Calculate Your RMD  

To calculate your RMD (*in 2025*), follow these steps:  

Determine Your Account Balance: Find the balance of your retirement account as of December 31 of the previous year.  

Use the [IRS Life Expectancy Factor](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100090068): Divide your account balance by the life expectancy factor from the IRS's Uniform Lifetime Table (*for Unmarried Owners, Married Owners Whose Spouses Aren't More Than 10 Years Younger, and Married Owners Whose Spouses Aren't the Sole Beneficiaries of Their IRAs*). This factor is based on your age.  

**Example Calculations**  
|Age | Account Balance | Life Expectancy Factor |  RMD Calculation  |    RMD    |
|:--:|:---------------:|:----------------------:|:-----------------:|:---------:|
| 73 |    $250,000     |          26.5          | $250,000 ÷ 26.5 = | $9,433.96 |
| 74 |    $240,566     |          25.5          | $240,566 ÷ 25.5 = | $9,433.96 |
| 75 |    $231,132     |          24.6          | $231,132 ÷ 24.6 = | $9,395.61 |
| 76 |    $221,736     |          23.7          | $221,736 ÷ 23.7 = | $9,355.95 |
| 77 |    $212,380     |          22.9          | $212,380 ÷ 22.9 = | $9,274.23 |

### Important Notes  

* RMDs are taxed as ordinary income.  
* You can withdraw more than the minimum required amount.  
* If you fail to take your RMD, you may face a penalty of 50% on the amount not withdrawn.  

### Special Considerations  

* RMD rules do not apply to Roth IRAs while the owner is alive.  
* If you have multiple IRAs, you can total the RMDs and withdraw from one account, but for employer-sponsored plans, you must take RMDs from each plan separately.  

Make sure to check the IRS guidelines annually for any updates on RMD calculations and requirements.
